My project is an attempt to mimick an ecommerce arena where registered users can buy and sell goods with their encrypted login information stored on a database.


My aim here was to blend together my knowledge of python, html, and database concepts to gain experience in front end and back end development all the while learning by doing in addition to following certain youtube channels and becoming more adept at solving problems with the help of stackoverflow, w3schools, etc in a timely fashion.


Many Thanks to Mr. Sonyl Nagale :slightly_smiling_face: for helping me deploy successfully.
