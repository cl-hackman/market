Many Thanks to Mr. Sonyl Nagale :slightly_smiling_face: for helping me deploy it successfully.

My project is an attempt to mimick an ecommerce arena where registered users can buy and sell goods with their encrypted login information stored on a database.

My aim here was to blend together my knowledge of python, html, and database concepts to gain experience in front and back end development all the while learning by doing in addtion to following certain youtube channels and becoming more adept at solving problems with the help of stackoverflow, w3schools, etc in a timely fashion.
